### 📌 **Alta-Tracker - Advanced Location Tracking Tool**  



![Alta-Tracker Screenshot](Templates/Tool1.png)  




**Alta-Tracker** is a powerful, lightweight location tracking tool developed by **Muhammad Alwaz**. It allows you to track a user's approximate location via **IP tracking** and fetch detailed **device information** such as:  
✔ **Battery Level**  
✔ **RAM Usage**  
✔ **Browser & OS Details**  
✔ **Exact GPS Location** (if permission is granted)  

The tool works by generating a **tracking link** that, when opened by the target, retrieves valuable **device information** and updates it in real time.
